## Milestone Project One 

---

### Intention 

This website is a fictional website for the purpose of my First Milestone Project for Code Institute’s Full Stack Software Developer Course. I created this website with the knowledge I gained from the HTML and CSS modules. 

The main goal of this project was to create a website for people to easily get in contact with a professional wristwatch company that services and cleans used watches for their customers. 

* Features I aimed to achieve with this project: 

 * To make the site easy to read. 
 * Create good contrast between the background and text (Only use Black and White colors).
 * Use Text Overlay for my text to create a “stand out” feeling and catch the attention of the user. 
 * Use a Navigation Bar that is easy to understand and easy to navigate between the three pages.

## UX

### Visitor Goals 

* To quickly understand what the website is all about and to easily navigate between: Menu I About us I Get in touch. 

* To collect visitors' contact information to give them a quote that includes a better understanding of what Andersson’s can offer for them since every wristwatch is unique. 

* To be accessible on all devices.

## Website Design 
---

Every Page on the website contains a Navigation menu at the top left of the Webpage. It is used to easily navigate between Menu I About us I Get in touch. It is featured on all three pages. 

Logo design - Because this website was created with the intention to keep it clean and simple. I decided to go with only “Andersson’s” instead of “Andersson’s Watch Restoration” or “Andersson’s Watch Service”. It also gave a better visual experience on smaller screen size devices. 

Background Image (Hero image) - I downloaded this image from pixabay.com which is a website with free images. The background image is used on all three pages and I used a black background color to it in case the image wouldn't load. 

Website Colors - I went for only Black and White to keep it clean and simple. 

Text Overlay - I used Text overlay for all text and the contact form on the page to let the Background image stand out and make it look better. 


### Color Scheme 

I chose four different colors for the website. Black, White, and medium-light grey for the Text Overlays to give it a good contrast to the background image. 

*#fff - White (HEX-color)*

### Landing Page Image  

* The landing page includes an image of a watch with a black background to make it stand out. The Background image is used on all three pages. I used Text Overlay to create a nice effect to the background containing a text with: “Life is too short to waste on a great watch. - So give it all the love it truly deserves!”. 

* This creates an eye-catching animation to grab the user's attention.

### Footer 

* The footer includes all the social media links to the relevant Social platform. The links will open in a new tab to not confuse the user.

### About us Page 

* The about us page is to inform the user about the business and what we aim to achieve in the services we provide to our customers. This is also created with Text Overlay to make it stand out from the background image without hiding it.

* I also added a Call to Action Button underneath the About us text to make sure the user takes action and goes directly to the contact form.
