# Andersson's 

A website for people to get in touch with Andersson's, a business that focuses on service wristwatches. Give their customers older wristwatches a fresher look and with a movement in better condition. 

Take a look at the website [here](https://erikandersson96.github.io/first-milestone/index.html).

## Milestone Project One 

---
### Intention 

This website is a `fictional website` for the purpose of my First Milestone Project for Code Institute’s Full Stack Software Developer Course. I created this website with the knowledge I gained from the `HTML` and `CSS` modules. 

The main goal of this project was to create a website for people to easily get in contact with a professional wristwatch company that services and cleans used watches for their customers. 

* Features I aimed to achieve with this project: 

 * To make the site `easy` to read. 
 * Create good contrast between the background and text `(Only use Black and White colors)`.
 * Use `Text Overlay` for my text to create a `“stand out”` feeling and catch the attention of the user. 
 * Use a `Navigation Bar` that is easy to understand and easy to navigate between the three pages.

## UX (User Experience)

### Visitor Goals 

* To quickly understand what the website is all about and to easily navigate between: Menu I About us I Get in touch. 

* To collect visitors' contact information to give them a quote that includes a better understanding of what Andersson’s can offer for them since every wristwatch is unique. 

* To be accessible on all devices. 


### Userstories 

* A users perspective: I want to easily understand the purpose of the website. 
* A users perspective: I want the website to be easily navigated between all pages.  
* A users perspective: I want the website to offer a clean look. 
* A users perspective: I wish that the website offers a easy to understand contact form. 


---
## Wireframes 

* First `4 images` is from the first idea and the wireframes is for `only desktop screens`. (I never did a wireframe for mobile use but I will do it for future projects): 
* Second row containing `4 images` is from the final product of the website. To give you a comparison: 

**First 4 images:** 

![Screenshot wireframe home page](/assets/images/wireframe-1.png)  

![Screenshot wireframe about us page](/assets/images/wireframe-2.png)

![Screenshot wireframe how it works page](/assets/images/wireframe-3.png)  

![Screenshot wireframe get in touch page](/assets/images/wireframe-4.png)

**Comparison, final product:** 

![Screenshot home page](/assets/images/wireframes-home.png) 

![Screenshot about us page](/assets/images/wireframe-about.png) 

![Screenshot get in touch page](/assets/images/wireframes-contact.png) 

**Changes:** 
* As you can see, I choose to only use three pages instead of four pages. Firstly that is because I didn’t find myself satisfied with the looks of including a video on the `“How it works”` page and secondly I didn’t find a video that suited me well enough. Therefore I felt that a fourth page (third page in the wireframes) felt unnecessary. 

* I also choose to with `another` background image than the one you can see from the wireframes. I will discuss this later down in the `Media section`. 

* The logo is also different. I discuss this as well in the `Website Design section`. 

* The footer also looks slightly different, I felt that most users use Social media platforms like `Instagram, LinkedIn, Youtube, Facebook`. And I also felt that it looked cleaner with only `four` Social media platforms.

* Lastly, the way the website displays text and the contact form differs a little bit but when I did the `wireframes` I didn’t think too much about what would be practical and `user-friendly` to meet the user stories expectations.

## Website Design 

Every Page on the website contains a `Navigation menu` at the top left of the `webpage`. It is used to easily navigate between `Menu | About us | Get in touch`. It is featured on all three pages. 

Logo design - Because this website was created with the intention to keep it clean and simple. I decided to go with only `“Andersson’s”` instead of `“Andersson’s Watch Restoration”` or `“Andersson’s Watch Service”`. It also gave a better visual experience on smaller screen size devices. 

Background Image (Hero image) - I downloaded this image from `pixabay.com` which is a website with free images. The background image is used on all `three pages` and I used a `black background color` to it in case the image wouldn't load. 

Website Colors - I went for only `Black and White` to keep it clean and simple. 

`Text Overlay` - I used `Text overlay` for all text and the contact form on the page to let the background image stand out and make it look better. 


### Color Scheme 

* I chose four different colors for the website. `Black, White, and medium-light grey` for the `Text Overlays` to give it a good contrast to the background image. 

**#fff - White (HEX-color)** 

![A white box with a thin grey border around it](/assets/images/white-box.png)

**#000000 - Black (HEX-color)** 

![A black box](/assets/images/black-box.png) 

**rgba (6, 6, 8, 0.753) - Medium light grey (RGB-color)**
This represents the Text Overlays. 

![A transparent box](/assets/images/transparent-box.png)


### Fonts 

* I used three different fonts for the website. `Oswald` for all `h1 and h2` and `“Open Sans”` for all body elements with `sans-serif` as a backup if `“Open Sans”` wouldn’t work. The `submit` button and the `call to action button` on the About us page are both using `Arial.` The `Oswald` and `“Open Sans”` fonts were taken from `Pairfonts`. `Arial` is a default font. 

**Oswald, h1, and h2:** 

![Image that displays how font Oswald look](/assets/images/oswald-image.png) 

**Open Sans, body:** 

![Image that displays how font Open Sans look](/assets/images/open-sans-image.png)

## Existing Features 


### Navigation Bar 

* Used for all three pages. Consisting of one Unordered List containing 
  `Home | About us | Get in touch.` 

![Screenshot of the Navigation bar](/assets/images/navbar-image.png)


### Landing Page   

* The landing page includes an image of a watch with a black background to make it stand out. The background image is used for all three pages. I used `Text Overlay` to create a nice effect to the background containing a text with: `“Life is too short to waste on a great watch. - So give it all the love it truly deserves!”.` 

* This creates an eye-catching contrast to grab the user's attention. 

![Screenshot of Landing Page](/assets/images/landing-page.png)


### Footer 

* The footer includes all the social media links to the relevant social platform. The links will open in a new tab to not confuse the user. Or open each social platform application on the device if the user interacts on a mobile device or tablet. 

![Screenshot of Footer](/assets/images/footer-image.png)


### About us  

* The about us page is to inform the user about the business and what we aim to achieve in the services we provide to our customers. This is also created with `Text Overlay` to make it stand out from the background image without hiding it.

* I also added a `Call to Action Button` underneath the `About us` information to direct the user to the contact form directly. 

![Screenshot of About us page](/assets/images/about-us-page.png)


### Get in touch 

* The Get in touch page includes two `Text Overlays.` The first one holds information about pricing and what services we offer. The second one is the contact form used to get the user’s contact information. The user has to fill in: `First Name, Last Name, E-mail, Brand of the watch, Budget, and additional information about their watch as Year, Condition, and if it is functional.` All text boxes are required to be filled in order to hit the Submit button underneath. 

* The Contact form is `refreshed` when clicking on the `Submit` button. It will also show the user that he or she needs to fill in all of the input fields that are `* required` with a warning text. 

* The input field for `Budget only accepts numbers.`

## Future Features 
 

### Learning Points 

* I'd like to include feedback to the user so they are aware that the information was submitted from the `Contact Form.` I didn't have the knowledge to include a `“Thank you for Submitting”` pop-up or redirect to a new page. But I will include this as soon as I have the knowledge required to do so in the next projects. 

* I made some mistakes when positioning each element: the text on the first page, the About us page, the Price information, and the `Contact form` on the third page. I used `"absolute"` instead of `“relative”` position which forced me to create a total of `13 Media Screen size breakpoints.` This is a mistake that I will take with me into the next project and improve upon to increase the amount of breakpoints. I will also start with creating the website for my next project on a mobile device first because it's much easier to expand the screen size than increase the screen size as I did with this project, which resulted in a lot of time wasted. 

* I also learned when git commit a message in `Gitpod` I should have only included what was relevant to that commit. I may have committed a message which included more changes than I added in that exact commit message, not only once but a couple of times. This is something that I will improve in my next project to be more consistent and correct with my commit messages. 

* The way I structured my `Media Screen size breakpoints` will improve for future projects. When I ran the `W3C CSS Validator` I got a ton of errors because I had included attributes in every `Media` query even if they were not changed between screen sizes which resulted in `287 parse errors`, but they are all fixed now. 


---
## Testing 

* All pages have been tested across all screen sizes for a responsive experience. The layout of the different elements on each page may have different positions to make it look good on each screen size. I tested this in the `Chrome dev tool, so I have not tested it on actual devices`.

* I used validators to ensure that my code was correct and up to standard. I did this with the use of `W3C validator` for HTML and `Jigsaw Validator` for CSS. 

* I made sure that the website looks good down to a screen size of 300px wide. 

* All links to external websites open in a new browser. 

* All Navigation bar links show with an underline which page you are on, and it also shows an underline on the nav link that you hover over with a mouse. 

* The Submit button in the Contact form shows a hover effect when hovered with a mouse. 


### Devices 
Something thats worth mentioning is that I've tested the majority of these devices within `Chrome dev tool`, I have not had physical access to test these devices. 
I have tested the responsiveness and aesthetics on the following devices and browsers: 

* **Apple** 
(Some features of the site, such as the Get in touch button on the About us page and the Submit button on Get in touch might not look the same depending on which `iOS update` the user has installed. But `iOS 15` will work correctly) 

  * iPhone 5/SE 
  * iPhone 6/7/8 
  * iPhone 6/7/8 Plus 
  * iPhone X/11 
  * iPad 
  * iPad Pro 

* **Android** 
  * Samsung Galaxy S5 
  * Microsoft Surface Duo 

* **Google Devices** 
  * Google Nest Hub 
  * Google Nest Hub Max 

* **Motorola**
  * Moto G4 

* **Desktops/laptops**
  * MacBook Pro 13" 
  * Lenovo 24" monitor 

* **Browsers**
  * Chrome 
  * Safari

### Validator Testing 

* **HTML-Validator**

When testing the website link at [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) I got these results:  

**Error 1:** 

I've got an error for using `h1` element more than in my logo. And this could confuse a screen reader because it will treat it as a `top-level heading.` 

![Screenshot of first HTML validation error](/assets/images/html-validator-error1.png)

**Solution:** 

I changed the `h1` tags to `h2` tags instead. 

After I corrected the Solution I got a new error: 

**Error 2:** 

My `action` attribute to my form element has no value.

![Screenshot of second HTML validation error](/assets/images/html-validator-error2.jpg)

**Solution 2:** 

I tried to remove the `action` attribute in my HTML without interfering with the experience of the website and it all worked. I also got no errors for my HTML after this when validating the HTML code again. 
  

**After I applied the HTML solutions:**

Here you can take a look at my `Approved` HTML for my [Home Page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Ferikandersson96.github.io%2Ffirst-milestone%2Findex.html). 

Here you can take a look at my `Approved` HTML for my [About us Page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Ferikandersson96.github.io%2Ffirst-milestone%2Fabout-us.html). 

Here you can take a look at my `Approved` HTML for my [Get in touch Page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Ferikandersson96.github.io%2Ffirst-milestone%2Fget-in-touch.html). 


* **CSS-Validator**  

When testing the website link at [Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator.html.en) I got these results:

**Error:** 

`287 Parse errors.` I had written for the font-family: `Open+Sans` and the `“+”` gave me an error for all of them. And I had also set every `Media` for all attributes of that `div` not only the attributes that I actually changed. And I also got an error for including too much unnecessary code within each `Media screen size breakpoint`, I didn’t only include the one parameters that I changed, I also included every each of them including the ones that I didn’t change. 

![Screenshot of CSS jigsaw validation error](/assets/images/css-validator-error.png)

**Here is an example of how i wrote "Open+Sans":**

![Screenshot of wrong spelling of font](/assets/images/wrong-opensans.png)

**Here is an example of how I structured my Media queries at first, which caused this parse error:** 

![Screenshot of wrong media queries structure](/assets/images/media-queries.png)

**Solution:** 

I changed every font to the correct spelling (from `Open+Sans` to `“Open Sans”`) and I also got rid of all unnecessary code in every @media screen breakpoint that I had included from the start. So from now on it only holds the changes made for every `13 breakpoints` in my CSS file. 


**After I applied the CSS solution:**
Here is a link to my Approved CSS jigsaw [Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Ferikandersson96.github.io%2Ffirst-milestone%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en).

### Lighthouse - Dev Tool 
I used `Chrome lighthouse dev tool` to test the website `performance`. I’ve got an average result of `98,6%` for desktop and `90%` for mobile devices. 

**Home Page (desktop)**

### Wave Page 

Each page has been tested through wave.webaim.org for accessibility. 

* You can look at the results [here](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://erikandersson96.github.io/first-milestone/index.html). 


--- 
## Fixed Bugs 

I validated my CSS and found `287 parse errors`. This was because I had written `Open+Sans` instead of `“Open Sans”`. As a result of the `287 parse errors`, I realized that I was inefficient with my CSS and refactored the `Media Queries` to only include code that had been changed. 

When I was running `Wave Page` I got `6 label errors` for my contact form. This was caused because I had written my HTML for the contact form in the wrong way without `correct labels`. I corrected this by correcting my HTML code for the contact form, with a correct `label` for each input field. 

* Here you can take a look at before and after screenshot of my `HTML` contact form: 

**Before:** 

![Screenshot wrong html contact form](/assets/images/wrong-contact.png)

**After:** 

![Screenshot correct html contact form](/assets/images/correct-contact.png)


--- 
## Unfixed Bugs 

When a user visits the website on an `Apple` mobile or tablet device with an older `iOS update` than `iOS 15`. They might not view the `“About us”` page call to action button that directs users to the contact form at the `“Get in touch”` page the same as on a desktop and other mobile devices. The `call to action button` should be within the `Text Overlay` that contains the `About us` information.

When I searched for a `solution` to this on the Internet I couldn’t figure out what caused this so I decided that I will leave it as an `unfixed bug`. 


--- 
## Deployment 

### Creating My Website 

When I created this website I used the `Code Institute Gitpod Full Template`. 

I frequently used `commit` throughout the whole project, this is the commands used in the terminal:  

`git add .` (This command is used for adding files to the staging area before committing). 

`git commit -m “commit message here..”` (This is used to label the commit changes made to the local repository). 

`git push` (This command is used to push all changes to the Github repository). 

This is all done to prevent any `data` loss in case Gitpod crashes. 


--- 
## GitHub Pages 

* The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 

1. Log in to Github and locate the Github `Repository`.
1. In the Github repository, navigate to the `settings` tab.
1. In the menu to the left, you will find `Pages` almost at the bottom of the list.
1. Under `“Source”`, click the dropdown menu called `“None”` and select `“Main”`. 
1. Click `save` and the page will automatically refresh with the website link displayed. 
1. The published `link` will show up above. Alternatively, click this [link](https://erikandersson96.github.io/first-milestone/).

## Credits 

### Content 

* The `Text Overlay` inspiration was taken from the `Love Running project`. 
* The design of the `Navigation Bar` was taken as inspiration from the `Love Running project`. 
* The `footer` was also taken as inspiration from the `Love Running project`. But the icons for the different social media was taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) (link).
* The fonts were taken from [Pair Fonts](https://pairfonts.com/) (link).


### Media 

* The Background Image (Hero image) was taken from [Pixa bay](https://pixabay.com/) (link). 
* I changed the background image one time since the original image made the contrast look bad. Because I chose to go with only `Black and White text`. The first image was also taken from [Pixa bay](https://pixabay.com/) (link). 

**First background image:**
