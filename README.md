## Milestone Project 1 

### Purpose 

This website was created to let people have their old vintage watch restord for a better condition. A lot of people have probably inherit an old vintage watch from their ancestors. It could be thier grandfhater/grandmothers old watch or someone of thier parents old watch that they used everyday. Either way it is probably well-worn and in need for a restoration to both look fresher and function more precisely.
